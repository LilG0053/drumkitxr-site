        <h2>Info</h2>
        <p>
            Silk Brush is a port of Tilt Brush to WebXR, with the aim of being as
            close in functionality to the original as possible. Currently, you are able to
            use all default brushes, save/load sketches, snapshots, and even do a basic export to .glb.
            There are a few third party integrations known not to work, and likely
            some that haven't been tested yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's possible that some data loss may occur between Silk Brush updates! Be sure to visit
            the <a href="files/">Files</a> page and save your work if you need to.
        </p>
        <h2>Exporting</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, you can export your model to .glb right from inside Silk Brush, and it will
            attempt to download it after a 5 second delay. In the event that it doesn't, however,
            you can browse to the <a href="files/">Files</a> page, where all your saved sketches,
            models, and snapshots are retrieved from local storage and made available to download.
        </p>
        <h2>Bugs/Issues</h2>
        <p>
            If you find any bugs/missing features, feel free to open an issue on the
            <a href="https://github.com/msub2/silk-brush">repo</a> if there's not one already
            and I'll do my best to address it.
